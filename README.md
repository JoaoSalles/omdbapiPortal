# React "almost complete" template

Tired of having to configure everything, every single time you have to start a new project? Or even have to copy from other projects and have to reconfigure if something changes? Deps get outdated?? Well, me too!!

That is why i created this. I aimed to have the bleeding edge of configuration on this template and it will always be up to date (because i will also use it when needed).

Just download this repo and you are good to start your new project with the bleeding edge. 

If you find something useful that can be added or modified, please :pray: open a PR!

This example contains: 
* `html-webpack-plugin`
* `mini-css-extract-plugin`
* `webpack-plugin-serve`
* `webpack-nano`
* `babel-loader`
* `css-loader`
* `file-loader/url-loader` (for images and fonts)
